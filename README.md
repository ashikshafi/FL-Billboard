# All outdoor billboards in Florida
This project explores the Florida Outdoor Advertising dataset available at http://fdotewp1.dot.state.fl.us/rightofway/DownloadData.aspx. 
The data gives cordinates (Latitude and longitude) of billboards in Florida state. I preprocessed the data and plotted the cordinates using Plotly. The reason I used Plotly is becuase it offers excellent visuals and interactive graphics.
